# Transferring data

Getting data onto a remote system and getting results back to your local computer can be a bit of a challenge sometimes.

## Command-line with `scp`/`sftp`

    scp localfile username@server:dest_dir/filename

    scp username@server:dest_dir/filename local_dir/local_file


## Cyberduck (GUI)


If you prefer a GUI program, one option is the [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) program. It is available for Windows and Mac, and can make it easy to upload and download data from a remote server. It is also available for free, which is another bonus (but there is a donation prompt that appears until you register the program for $10).
