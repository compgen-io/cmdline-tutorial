# Customizing your shell

If you're using the `bash` shell (and this is the default on many systems), 
then you can edit the file `$HOME/.bashrc` to customize your shell.

Another common shell is `zsh` (the new default on macOS). If you are using this shell,
then you can edit the file `$HOME/.zshrc`.

!!! note
    There are a few zsh special functions, but zsh can be considered a close relative of bash. 
    Most of the commands from bash will work in zsh (but not vice-versa).

#### How do you find out which one you're using?

There are a few methods, but the easiest is to run this snippet:

    $ echo $SHELL

It will print out the exact program that you are currently using for your shell. So long as you are
using either bash or zsh, this page will work for you. If you have a different shell (csh, tcsh, etc),
then you're on your own. ðŸ˜€
