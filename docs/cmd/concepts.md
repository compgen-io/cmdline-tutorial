# Concepts

Linux and Unix in general is built upon a few key concepts. Knowing these concepts will help you understand what programs are available to you, and when each of them is appropriate. The "design" of most Linux systems is consistent with these concepts, regardless of which specific flavor (or distribution) or Linux you are using. These concepts are also applicable to other operating systems (Mac and Windows), to some extent.
