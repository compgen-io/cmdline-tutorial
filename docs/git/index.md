# Git source control

Still working on this...

Git is a version control program. This means that it is used for keeping track of the changes to different files in a repository. When you use git, you can keep track of changes that you've made and roll them back if necessary. However, the real power of git comes into play when you're working with others. In this mode, you can share code or document cahnges with a collaborator. You can both work on the same project independently and then let git help you manage merging your work together.
