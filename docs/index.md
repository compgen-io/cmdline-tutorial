# Welcome to the command-line { #markdown data-toc-label='Welcome' }

Using a command-line to interact with either your computer or a remote server can be a great way to get things done. A command-line is a powerful tool for working with a computer of any size. In particular, with command-lines, automating data analysis workflows can be performed by chaining together different programs. By chaining programs together, you can create complex workflows with surprisingly simple components.  Additionally, many large systems, such as high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, only allow for command-line access, with occasional web-based access for specific tools that require a GUI.

Learning to use the command-line can make almost any data analysis task easier.
